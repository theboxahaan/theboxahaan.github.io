Well let's try to blink the onboard `ACT` led. [@dwelch67](https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi/tree/master/blinker01) did the same thing on the Raspberry Pi with the `BCM2835`SoC <!--more--> and I have referred to his code almost completely. The source code files can be found in the repo in the `blink` directory.

The `BCM2835` has its onboard `ACT` led connected to `GPIO16` pin, triggering which, turns on/off the led. 
> *How do we know that `GPIO16` is the one ?* 

Well Broadcom basically told us. They released the full schematics of the Raspberry Pi<sup>[[1]](https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2012/04/Raspberry-Pi-Schematics-R1.0.pdf)</sup> which clearly show the `GPIO16` getting mapped to the `STATUS_LED_N`. 
No such luck with the RPi4 though. The released *reduced* schematics<sup>[[2]](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/schematics/rpi_SCH_4b_4p0_reduced.pdf)</sup> are laughably bad for this and hence of no use. Moreover, the `ACT` led is mapped to the `eMMC` activity and is a cruel tantalizer. However, this **blog**<sup>[[3]](https://www.valvers.com/open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-1/)</sup> takes an interesting approach by analysing the kernel device tree source `(*dts)` file<sup>[[4]](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-4.19.y/arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dts)</sup>, which leads us to `GPIO42`.

<img width="60%" alt="gpio42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32961084/87415214-71c55b80-c5ea-11ea-96fa-b71a5d92890d.png">

`arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dts`

<br>
Just to test it out, lets run a python script to toggle the `ACT` led by manipulating `GPIO42`.
{% highlight python %}
import time
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(42,GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.output(42, GPIO.HIGH)
time.sleep(2)
GPIO.output(42, GPIO.LOW)
{% endhighlight %}

## üçª It works !!!

Observe that the `ACT` led turns on and off. In fact even if the `GPIO.output(42, GPIO.LOW)` is commented out, the `ACT` led still die out after a few seconds. This is **probably** because of the interference with the `eMMC` trigger. This can be rectified by reassigning the `ACT` led to some other pin *(16)* by adding a device tree directive<sup>[[5]](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md)</sup> -
```
dtparam=aci_led_gpio=16
```
in the `config.txt` file in the `boot` partition of the SD card.

<br>
## Direct Register Manipulation
The following C code is supposed to toggle `GPIO42` on & off by writing to the registers mapped to the `GPIO42` pin. The addresses of the registers, functions details etc. are all mentioned in the **ARM Peripherals**<sup>[[6]](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2711/rpi_DATA_2711_1p0.pdf)</sup> doc. Memory Mapped GPIOs are basically used as follows -
- Select the appropriate functions for the GPIO pins using the `GPFSEL{n}` registers
- Set / Clear the pins using `GPSET/GPCLR`


| `Warning` |
|-----------|
| Do Note that the doc has errors. It lists the `GPIO` register base address as `0x7E21 5000`, which is wrong. The base address is at low peripheral mode addressed `OxFE20 0000` or legacy `0x7E20 0000`|

```c
#include<stdint.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<fcntl.h>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<sys/mman.h>
#include<sys/stat.h>
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stddef.h>

#define SIZE 4096
#define GPIO_BASE 0xfe200000
#define GPFSEL4 0x4
#define GPSET1 0x8
#define GPCLR1 0xb

volatile uint32_t* gpio_base;

int main()
{
	int fd;
	if((fd = open("/dev/mem", O_RDWR|O_SYNC)) < 0 )
		{
			printf("/dev/mem Not Opened \n");
			return -1;
		}
	gpio_base = (uint32_t*)mmap(NULL, SIZE, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, GPIO_BASE);
	printf("MMAP DONE %p \n", gpio_base);
	printf("GPFSEL4: %u\n", gpio_base[GPFSEL4]);
	gpio_base[GPFSEL4] &= ~(7 << 6);
	gpio_base[GPFSEL4] |= 1 << 6 ;
	printf("MODGPFSEL4: %d\n", gpio_base[GPFSEL4]);
	
	while(1){
		gpio_base[GPSET1] = (1 << 10);
		sleep(1);
		gpio_base[GPCLR1] = (1 << 10);
		sleep(1);
		}
	return 0;
}

```

### What the code is essentially doing

`gpio_base[GPFSEL4] &= ~(7 << 6);` sets `bits 6-8` to `0` and is sometimes referred to as *cleaning*. We consider those specific bits as `GPIO42` is controlled by `GPFSEL4[6:8]`

`gpio_base[GPFSEL4] |= 1 << 6 ;` sets it as an *output* pin.

`gpio_base[GPSET1] = (1 << 10);` pulls the pin high(or low)

Compile the above program and run it as root (to register a memory map for `/dev/mem`).

## Baremetal 
This involves writing a custom `kernel7l.img` file which is very similar to the above program. We'll still be using `32 bit low peripheral mode addresses` as that is what the ARM is configured to handle *by default*. Note that since this time, we will be running our script without a kernel ( our script will be the kernel ) and hence shall need to compile and link it appropriately. I have provided two separate implementations, one discussed below and the other borrowing from [@dwelch67](https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi/tree/master/blinker01)

To compile these examples, I used a cross-compiler from the [ARM Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
```c
#define GPIO_BASE 0xFE200000
#define GPFSEL4 0x4
#define GPSET1 0x8
#define GPCLR1 0xB

volatile unsigned int* gpio_base = (unsigned int* )GPIO_BASE;
volatile unsigned int time;

int main(void) __attribute__((naked));
int main(void)
{
	gpio_base[GPFSEL4] &= ~(7 << 6);
	gpio_base[GPFSEL4] |= (1 << 6);
	while(1)
	{
		for(time=0; time<50000; time++);
		gpio_base[GPSET1] = (1 << 10);

		for(time=0; time<50000; time++);
		gpio_base[GPCLR1] = (1 << 10);

	}
}
```

The `Makefile` for the above script is 

```shell
ARMGNU ?= arm-none-eabi

COPS = -nostartfiles -mfloat -abi=hard -mfpu=crypto-neon-fp-armv8 -march=armv8-a+crc -mcpu=cortex-a72

all : kernel7l.img

clean:
	rm -f *.o
	rm -f *.bin
	rm -f *.elf
	rm -f *.list
	rm -f *.img

blinker.o : blinker.c
	$(ARMGNU)-gcc $(COPS) -c blinker.c -o blinker.o

kernel7l.img : blinker.o
	$(ARMGNU)-ld blinker.o -o blinker.elf
	$(ARMGNU)-objcopy blinker.elf -O binary kernel7l.img		
```

Make sure, that the `$PATH` variable has the location of the cross-compiler after which navigate to the directory contating the `Makefile` and execute
```
make
```
And the `.img` file should compile
