The MILP modelling of `Keccak-p[400]` using Nicky Mouhaâ€™s method and the S-bP extensions as discussed in class.

## Keccak SBox

$$\chi : a_{i,j} \leftarrow a_{i,j} \oplus (a^{'}_{(i+1),j})a_{(i+2),j}$$

Thus $$\chi$$ can be said to be an $$[5 \times 5]$$ bit SBox acting on each row of the state.


```
SBox := [0, 5, 10, 11, 20, 17, 22, 23, 9, 12, 3, 2, 13, 8, 15,
14, 18, 21, 24, 27,  6, 1, 4, 7, 26, 29, 16, 19, 30, 25, 28, 31]
```

## MILP Model
Implemented as was done for `PRESENT` in class

### Objective
Each Sbox is represented by a boolean variables. Objective is to minimize the sum of these variables.

### Inputs
The `400` bit *input difference* is given 

### Constraints
- $$\rho, \pi$$ are simple permutations.
- $$\iota$$ is addition with a fixed constant, hence we need not worry about it
- Only hassle is with $$\theta$$


### Modelling $$\theta$$
$$\theta : A[x,y,z] = A[x,y,z] \oplus \bigoplus_{j=0}^{4}A[x-1,j,z] \oplus A[x+1, j, z-1]$$

So essentially this function is a XOR operation amongst 11 bits.

I tried simplifying it using a parity bit approach i.e.

- Compute the parity bits for each column
- XOR proper parity bits

So essentially now this functions was broken into two sub-functions havin 5 bit and 3 bit XORs respectively.

So now I tried modelling $$\theta$$ using Mouhaâ€™s method -


- Computing Parity Plane

$$
\begin{align}
x_{i,0,k} + x_{i,1,k} + x_{i,2,k} + x_{i,3,k} + x_{i,4,k} + p_{i,k} &\geq 2d_{i,j}\\
d_{i,j} &\geq x_{i,j,k} , p_{i,k}
\end{align}
$$

- Computing $\theta$

$$
\begin{align}
x_{i,j,k} + p_{(i-1),k} + p_{(i+1), (z-1)} + y_{i,j,k} &\geq 2e_{i,j,k}\\
e_{i,j,k} &\geq x_{i,j,k} , p_{i,k}
\end{align}
$$

### Problem

With this formulation of $$\theta$$, after formulation of the other functions, Gurobi was giving the optimal solution to be $$0$$
I exported the result file using the command -
`gurobi_cl ResultFile=r1.sol r1.lp`

The problem was that Gurobi had assigned all $$x$$â€™s and $$p$$â€™s the value $$1$$, that is the input difference had all values $$1$$. By doing so, the value of all $$y$$â€™s could be assigned as $$0$$ and still satisfy the above constraints. 
And now, since a zero state was being permuted, the input to the $$\chi$$ layer was all zeros. Hence the optimal solution was $$0$$

### Solving The Problem

Mouhaâ€™s constraints do not model the the XOR function exactly. Example for function $$a \oplus b = c$$.
Mouhaâ€™s constraints are -

$$
\begin{align}
a + b + c &\geq 2d_0\\
d &\geq a\\
d &\geq b\\
d &\geq c\\
\end{align}
$$

The truth table for the above constraints is -

| $$a$$ | $$b$$ | $$c$$ | $$d_0$$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 0     | 0     | 0     | 0       |
| 0     | 1     | 1     | 1       |
| 1     | 0     | 1     | 1       |
| 1     | 1     | 0     | 1       |
| 1     | 1     | 1     | 1       |

The last row satisfies the constraints, but it **invalidates the XOR rule**. When the number of elements being XORâ€™d is greater, the number of such invalid cases also increases.

A possible solution could be to add another constraint

$$2d_0 - a - b - c \geq 0$$

Adding this to the list of constraints started to give out results in the MILP model.
$$d_0$$ is no longer constrained to be a boolean. Its only constrained to be an integer.


### Solution Found By the Gurobi Solver For 1 Round Keccak
Optimal = 1

<img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_48455D6ADC8DFBB72F715F59DE88DEC845623C60D1CA368FED24D2707582F853_1589326815952_Capture.PNG" width="80%">


The picture shows the $$x$$â€™s and $$y$$â€™s . $$x$$ is the input difference found by gurobi. and $$y = \pi \circ \rho \circ \theta (x)$$

For finding $$x$$ (as shown above) I wrote a script to parse the `.sol` file generated by gurobi that gives out the values of the variables at the optimal. $$y$$ was found by applying the proper operations on $$x$$

~~**Problem**~~ **Resolved**
~~The~~ $$y$$ ~~values obtained from parsing the file do not match with the~~ $$y$$ ~~values obtained from~~ $$x$$~~. The parsed~~ $$y$$ ~~values show 2 active SBoxes instead of 1 ðŸ˜•.~~ 
This is because parsed $$y$$ values represent the values obtained immediately after $$\theta$$ is applied on $$x$$. **This has been verified.**
So need to look into that. For the figure given below, blue bits are active.

|$x$ values |$y$ values|

~~The~~ $$x$$ ~~values found do lead to~~ $$1$$ ~~Active Sbox, but the~~ $$y$$ ~~values show otherwise. ðŸ˜ž~~ 
Observed that $$y = \theta(x)$$
Final values (represented by $$z$$ ) show correct number of SBoxes as active

### Note
> Another observation is that the transition of   $$\chi \circ \pi \circ \rho(y) \rightarrow z$$ might have a zero probability as the constraints are not tight enough on the SBox.
> As from the example above, the difference transition is  $$[0,0,1,1,0] \rightarrow [0,1,1,0,0]$$. However this transition is impossible with the SBox (confirmed with the DDT)


### Generating the `.lp` File
```bash
python mew.py --r [no. of rounds] > rounds.lp
```
This will output a file in the `LP Format` which can be used as input to a suitable solver. I used Gurobi.

## Keccak Implementation

Implemented as class `Keccak` in `python3` . Each round is implemented as $$\iota \circ \chi \circ \pi \circ \rho \circ \theta$$
Of these functions, $$\iota$$ has not been implemented.
Implementation verified with the following sources - 

1. [https://github.com/mgoffin/keccak-python/blob/master/Keccak.py](https://github.com/mgoffin/keccak-python/blob/master/Keccak.py)
    > The verification was successful only after changing the rotation from a left rotate to a right rotate for $$\rho$$ function
