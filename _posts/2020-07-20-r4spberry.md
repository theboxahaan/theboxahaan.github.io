This wiki basically captures my notes while fiddling around with the `Raspberry Pi 4B`.<!--more--> I will probably rewrite this many times over the course of getting something useful out of it, so bear with `(‡≤†_‡≤†)`

The board in question is a <strong>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2GB RAM</strong><sup><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup>. This time the board is equipped with a BCM2711 Quad core Cortex-A72<sup>[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A72)</sup> (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC . And they have <em>very graciously</em> made some documentation available.<sup><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2711/README.md" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup>. The <code>BCM2711</code> contains as mentioned, quad core <code>Cortex-A72 Arm V8</code> Based Soc as the processing unit with <code>64 bit</code> cores. For the GPU, we have a <strong>new</strong> <code>32 bit</code> VideCore<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VideoCore)</sup> VI 3D unit clocked at 500MHz, with no documentation available. üëè  Note that at the time of writing, Raspberry Pi OS does not officially have a 64 bit distribution.

## Installing The Raspbian Image <sup>[[4]](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md)</sup>
I chose to go with the [Raspberry Pi OS(32 bit) Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/) based on `Debian Buster` at the time, because of its small size. Installing it onto a FAT32 formatted SD Card was fairly straightforward. 

```shellscript
dd bs=4M if=2020-02-13-raspios-buster.img of=/dev/<sdX> \
conv=fsync status=progress
```
This creates two partitions, namely, `boot` and `rootfs`. The latter contains distribution specific files and the root file system. `boot` is mounted as `\boot` once Linux has booted and is what I am mostly interested in.
The installation by default writes a multitude of files in the `boot` partition to support various Raspberry Pi models, the specifics of which  are are summarised in the official [docs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/boot_folder.md#:~:text=documentation%20%3E%20configuration%20%3E%20boot_folder-,The%20boot%20folder,%2C%20macOS%2C%20and%20Linux%20devices.).
According to it, RPi4 basically cares about `start4*.elf`, `kernel7l.img` and the relevant`(BCM2711)` device tree blobs. Experimenting with removing various files confirmed the minimal requirement for a working boot to be-
<pre>
boot
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bootcode.bin
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmdline.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ COPYING.linux
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fixup4*.dat
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ issue.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kernel7l.img
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENCE.broadcom
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <b>overlays</b>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ start4*.elf

</pre>

## Configuring Headless Raspberry Pi<sup>[[5]](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md)</sup>
SSH access to the raspberry pi can can be configured by creating an empty `ssh` file and a `wpa_supplicant.conf` file containing the wifi credentials in the `boot` partition. 
```
touch ssh
```
`wpa_supplicant.conf` example
```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>

network={
 ssid="<Name of your wireless LAN>"
 psk="<Password for your wireless LAN>"
}
```
Once Linux is booted, the Pi should automatically connect to the `SSID` specified.
> Set up a mobile hotspot, so that you can monitor when the pi connects to the network. This also helps in easily retirieving the IP address assigned to the Pi. The default connection identifier is `raspberrypi`

### Connecting via SSH
There is no point setting a VNC as this Linux distrib does not have a desktop, so SSH is the way to go. Raspberry Pi 4 supports `mDNS` which makes things easier as we are not bothered by the exact IP. To check the availability for connecting, make sure your client is on the same network as the Pi and ping it-
```
ping raspberrypi.local
```
If responses are successful, we can initiate an SSH connection by `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local` with the default password being `raspberry`. This should get an SSH session started.
